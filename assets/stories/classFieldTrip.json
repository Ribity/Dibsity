   "Class Field Trip",
   "It had been a long week at school, but the day had finally arrived.",
   "CHAR1 jumped out of bed, even before parent1 had called him1.",
   "CHAR1 hurried to get dressed.",
   "He1 raced into the bathroom to brush his1 teeth and combed his1 hair.",
   "CHAR1 ran into the kitchen and plopped down at the kitchen table.",
   "Coco Puffs was the cereal by choice this morning.",
   "CHAR1 poured a generous helping of Coco Puffs and topped it off with milk.",
   "CHAR1 thought this was the best way to start the morning.",
   "Especially when it was a new box of Coco Puffs, as there was always a toy in the box.",
   "This morning CHAR1 found a small bouncing ball deep down in the box of Coco Puffs.",
   "CHAR1 put the ball down on the kitchen table and continued to eat his1 bowl of Coco Puffs.",
   "The ball rolled off the table and fell to the floor.",
   "petname1, his1 pet1, ran over and began to swat the ball around the house.",
   "petname1 would jump and play as he ran after it.",
   "CHAR1 laughed with joy.",
   "CHAR1's parent1 almost stepped on the ball.",
   "she1 picked it up and put it in a basket on the kitchen counter for another time.",
   "When CHAR1 was1 finished with breakfast, she1 gathered her1 book-bag, and she1 ran out the door just in time to catch the school bus.",
   "CHAR1 sat in the seat with his1 best friend, CHAR2.",
   "They greeted each other and began to talk about the day ahead.",
   "They both knew this was the day they had been waiting for.",
   "It was the day of the annual class field trip.",
   "This year the class would be heading out on the activity bus to the Jenkins dairy farm.",
   "'Wow, how fun was this going to be to see real live cows!'",
   "Char2 said, 'I hope I'm able to touch a cow'.",
   "After CHAR1 and CHAR2 arrived at school, they raced into their class and promptly took their assigned seats.",
   "When everyone was there and quietly sitting in their seats, the teacher told them what to expect for their trip.",
   "Everyone would load into the activity buses. They would head out to the dairy farm where they would unload.",
   "They would form teams of ten classmates along with one guide per team.",
   "The teacher told them they had to stay together in their team while they were at the dairy farm.",
   "She also told them they were not allowed to scream or run around.",
   "Everyone promised to do as they were told.",
   "It was finally time to load the buses.",
   "CHAR1 and CHAR2 loaded the bus together. They always sat beside each other.",
   "CHAR1 and CHAR2 laughed and giggled all the way to the Dairy farm.",
   "Before they knew it, they had arrived.",
   "CHAR1 and CHAR2 waited their turn to unload the bus.",
   "When they stepped off the bus, they were happy they were on the same team.",
   "As they looked around, the one thing they noticed immediately was the smell.",
   "It smelled kind of bad.",
   "But no worries. They soon got use to the smell.",
   "They followed their guide and went into a big building.",
   "Inside the building they found these really big and tall cows. The were mooing and eating.",
   "CHAR1 said, 'Wow!  These cows are taller than parent1'.",
   "CHAR2 said, 'They are taller than my dad and my mom put together!'.",
   "CHAR1 and CHAR2 giggled.",
   "As CHAR1 and CHAR2 continued to follow in a line, they noticed a machine was attached to each one of the cow's tummies.",
   "The guide told them the machines were automatic milking machines.",
   "The guide continued to tell them each machine was like a hand that automatically milked each cow.",
   "The milk went down into a tube and was collected in another room in giant containers for processing.",
   "Once processed, the milk was poured into milk cartons and trucked to the grocery stores.",
   "CHAR1 and CHAR2 thought this was incredible.",
   "The cows didn't even mind.",
   "Who would have guessed this is where the milk for cereal came from?",
   "After walking and looking at the cows, it was finally time for lunch.",
   "The entire class sat outside underneath this big maple tree.",
   "They ate the lunches each had brought for themselves.",
   "CHAR1 traded his1 bag of potato chips for CHAR2's chocolate chip cookies.",
   "Everyone sat eating and talking about who saw the biggest cow.",
   "They laughed about the funny things each had seen.",
   "When CHAR1 got home from school that day, he1 sat at the kitchen table eating snack1.",
   "He1 told char4 and char5 of everything He1 saw while at the farm that day.",
   "CHAR1 said, 'The cows looked like giant monsters as they were staring down at me'.",
   "They were staring while eating their food and getting milked by the machines at the same time.",
   "It was hard for CHAR1 to believe this is where the milk each morning he1 had on his1 cereal came from.",
   "CHAR1 told parent1 it was the best field trip ever!",
